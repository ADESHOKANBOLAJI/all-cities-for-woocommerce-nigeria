# cities-for-woocommerce
Have you always wanted to create shipping zones that covers not only the state level in woocommerce? Worry no more for this plugin will solve all that problem.
All you need do is edit the $cities array to fit your various location and it will resolve the problem for you.
I already created cities that covers Lagos Island, Lagos Mainland and Other states in Nigeria.
To use this plugin for other countries, you will need to change the $states key from 'NG' to woocommerce recognised key for your country.

Thank you for using this plugin.
